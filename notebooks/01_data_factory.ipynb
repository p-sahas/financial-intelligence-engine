                        "Answer : The text suggests that licenses for intellectual property held by others may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\n",
                        "question : What tone does the text convey regarding the challenges of licensing intellectual property?\n",

                        "Answer : Changes in accounting methods could result in alterations to financial statements, including variations in revenue and expenses for any period. This may lead to certain categories of revenue and expenses being reported in different periods, potentially resulting in materially different financial results. Additionally, it may necessitate changes in how financial information is processed, analyzed, and reported, as well as adjustments to financial reporting controls.\n",
                        "question : In what ways could the company's financial reporting controls be impacted by changes in accounting principles?\n",
